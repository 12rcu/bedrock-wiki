However, in contrast to Java, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang instead of the community.</p><p>In general, you can think of <em>mods</em> as <em>modifying</em> the game, and <em>addons</em> as <em>adding-onto</em> the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.</p><h2 id="what-is-this-guide"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-this-guide" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is this guide?</h2><p>This guide is a beginner tutorial, intended to walk you through the first stages of addon-creation. You will create your very own fully-functional Ghost entity, as well as an Ectoplasm item, and some other associated files.</p><p>By the end of this guide, you will have created an entire addon all by yourself, which you can play with and modify!</p><h2 id="is-the-guide-up-to-date"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-the-guide-up-to-date" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Is the guide up to date?</h2><p>This guide is written for the most recent <em>stable</em> release of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Many things won&#39;t work in previous versions, and some will be changed in later ones.
