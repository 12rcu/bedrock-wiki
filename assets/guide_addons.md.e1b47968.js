Addons are very powerful and allow us create custom entities, items, and blocks, as well as things like custom loot tables and crafting recipes. Your imagination is the limit!</p><p>Addons are primarily written in <a href="./understanding-json.html">json</a>, which is a structured data-format. An addon is essentially a collection of json files, images, and sounds, which modify or add to the game in some way.</p><h2 id="behavior-pack-vs-resource-pack"><a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior-pack-vs-resource-pack" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Behavior Pack Vs. Resource Pack</h2><p>Addons are split into two pack types: Resource Packs, and Behavior Packs. Both can function independently, but they are most commonly used together. When you have both a Resource Pack and Behavior Pack, this is referred to as an <em>addon</em>.</p><h3 id="resource-pack"><a class="header-anchor" href="#resource-pack" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Resource Pack</h3><p>The Resource Pack, also known as the <em>client</em>, or RP, is responsible for the <em>visuals</em> and <em>sounds</em> in your addon. This includes things like:</p><ul><li>Textures</li><li>Sounds</li><li>Geometry</li><li>Animations</li><li>Particles</li></ul><h3 id="behavior-pack"><a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior-pack" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Behavior Pack</h3><p>The Behavior Pack, also known as the <em>server</em>, or BP, is responsible for the <em>logic</em> of your addon. This can include things like:</p><ul><li>How your entity acts</li><li>Crafting recipes</li><li>Loot tables</li><li>Custom functions</li></ul><h3 id="communication-between-packs"><a class="header-anchor" href="#communication-between-packs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Communication between packs</h3><p>In most cases, you will have both a RP and a BP together. These packs can communicate with each other, in the sense that assets defined in one can be accessed in the other. For example, when creating a custom entity, you need two files:</p><ul><li>An RP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>look</em></li><li>A BP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>act</em></li></ul>',14);t.render=function(i,o,t,s,r,c){return e(),a("div",null,[n])};export default t;export{o as __pageData};
