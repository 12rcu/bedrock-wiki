QuickJS is much slower (mostly because it lacks JIT) and in some communities that is a big con to using it</p></li><li><p><strong>A</strong>: A few of us have used QuickJS in past projects and its very easy to integrate. We have looked at V8 (and others) and we may move to them in the future.

File and network APIs would require privileges and likely consent by the game owner, so those probably won&#39;t be in the default set of APIs, but we may add those capabilities down the road (e.g., potentially for server owners)</p></li></ul><h3 id="so-such-interface-will-only-be-implemented-on-part-of-all-available-platforms"><a class="header-anchor" href="#so-such-interface-will-only-be-implemented-on-part-of-all-available-platforms" aria-hidden="true">#</a> So such interface will only be implemented on part of all available platforms?</h3><ul><li>We strive to implement all APIs across all platforms.

Or, in what ways are you utilizing the testing API on your own content?</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! We have lots of tests for vanilla content right now and want to expand that to more and more over time. We actually ship some of the tests we have for vanilla content in our public builds (vanilla_gametest).</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Ideally, over time, the community would also help us by using GameTest to report bugs with vanilla and we could incorporate those tests (once we fix the issue) and make sure we don&#39;t break that stuff again :slight_smile:</p></li></ul><h2 id="could-we-get-a-timeline-of-what-events-are-planned-for-the-api-next"><a class="header-anchor" href="#could-we-get-a-timeline-of-what-events-are-planned-for-the-api-next" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Could we get a timeline of what events are planned for the API next?</h2><ul><li><p>Our team is still deciding which events to add next so there isn&#39;t much of a timeline we can share.

Can you talk about &quot;what you did different&quot; this time? Additionally, what needs to happen for GameTest to be considered &quot;successful&quot; (and therefor not abandoned). Is there anything we can do to help with that?</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> In general we&#39;re trying to be pretty focused on the scenarios we&#39;re targeting, starting with content testing and validation which we can always use more of not just for core Minecraft but also for custom content in Minecraft. We really want to make it simpler for folks to scaffold and build tests around their content. That scenario also has more limited requirements (e.g., we can be on fewer platforms, perf is not as much an issue, etc.) So, we are focused on GameTest and for that to be successful we&#39;d want to see that it&#39;s easy for content creators to test their stuff.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Of course, we do see the potential for more scenarios down the road - including gameplay - but we really don&#39;t want to get anyones expectations high (or have people take a bet on scripting/gametest APIs for gameplay) until we have a bit more validation on things like perf, and getting support for more platforms, and responding to your feedback as well.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> RE: Is there anything we can do to help with that? - Keep engaging with us on improving and adding new stuff! :slight_smile: The creator community is the driver for all of this.</p></li></ul><h2 id="consoles"><a class="header-anchor" href="#consoles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Consoles</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the reason that consoles cannot run gametests, and will consoles eventually support the gametest API in the future?</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! we plan to support all our platforms, a couple of platforms didn&#39;t have all the API&#39;s our JS Engine Required, aligned_alloc was one. We are actively working on enabling those platforms.</p></li></ul><h1 id="will-there-be-any-support-for-gametests-to-support-different-languages"><a class="header-anchor" href="#will-there-be-any-support-for-gametests-to-support-different-languages" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Will there be any support for gametests to support different languages?</h1><ul><li>We&#39;ve implemented the binding layer generically enough to fit into other programming/scripting languages.

I don&#39;t think we can commit to adding any official support for other languages at the moment though :slight_smile:</li></ul><h3 id="have-you-considered-kotlin"><a class="header-anchor" href="#have-you-considered-kotlin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Have you considered Kotlin</h3><ul><li>I haven&#39;t looking into Kotlin much (all of our Android platform is still written in Java :slight_smile: ) but that sounds sweet!

How do you position the relationship between the event system in the gametest framework and the event system in data-driven? Will an interface between the two be provided in the future?</h2><ul><li>We want the systems to play well together. If you&#39;re familiar with building with data driving , we&#39;d like you to be able to sprinkle in script in a way that makes sense. We&#39;re still working out exactly what that looks like.</li></ul><h2 id="anything-in-our-not-list"><a class="header-anchor" href="#anything-in-our-not-list" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Anything in our NOT list?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you share anything from your &#39;Not List&#39; (things you&#39;ve discussed, and decided unilaterally NOT to implement)? This could be certain devices you won&#39;t support, or certain directions you don&#39;t want to take the API. Pretty much anything off the table.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Great question. There&#39;s little in our list of &quot;absolutely not&quot; list.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Here are some things in our &quot;use extreme caution&quot; list:</p><ul><li>Network access</li><li>File access</li><li>Platform specific APIs</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Network access is something that we might allow through very structured APIs to specific targets. Same with files: we will likely have some kind of persistent storage, but not free form files.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Platform specific APIs are something we&#39;d like to avoid. But we can imagine implementing desktop specific APIs for editor scenarios. We&#39;d avoid that for gameplay and gametest scenarios.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Another thing that I&#39;d love to expose that is super hard is custom shaders. PlayStation requires that shaders are built into the submission. So we&#39;ll have to approach this by providing a physically based materials system where we hard code very flexible shaders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q:</strong> with said &quot;persistent storage&quot; are we gonna have a method to write and read simple int variables in a instance-indipendent manner? or is it still gonna be in the instance and deleted when runtime ends?</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes we have plans to add key value pair storage maybe Json storage. One would be with a Javascript Api for accessing tags and scoreboards. but going further would be to allow for generic read write storage (still not direct File system access). There are some security issues we&#39;d want to work through around ensuring storage is sand boxed per pack.</p></li></ul><h2 id="plans-to-support-gametests-on-custom-dimensions-if-that-ever-happened"><a class="header-anchor" href="#plans-to-support-gametests-on-custom-dimensions-if-that-ever-happened" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Plans to support GameTests on custom dimensions, if that ever happened?</h2><ul><li>While designing the GameTest APIs we&#39;ve been keeping custom content in mind. That&#39;s actually why Commands.run takes the dimension as a string, rather than a hard-coded dimension variable for example. So we&#39;re definitely leaving open the possibility for integration with custom dimensions and other custom content down the road.</li></ul><h2 id="old-scripting-api"><a class="header-anchor" href="#old-scripting-api" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Old Scripting API</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Q:</strong> What will happen to the old scripting api? Is it still going to stay available but with no updates? (That is it will never become unsupported)</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> The original scripting API will be available (and as you&#39;ve noticed, it hasn&#39;t gotten really any updates in the recent past.) As gametest APIs and other systems of gameplay logic evolve to potentially cover the capabilities of scripting v1, we&#39;d remove the scripting V1 functionality.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> The old scripting API was experimental, so there isn&#39;t nearly as much (well, any) guarantee of backwards compatibility. And the old scripting API wasn&#39;t available on mobile devices, and we&#39;d not expand its platform support at this point.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> We do want to support client-side experiences and things like UI - we have a number of ideas on how to do that not a firm plan as yet</p></li></ul><h2 id="world-generation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#world-generation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> World Generation</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Any plans for exposing the world noise in GameTests? Noise libraries exist for JS, but what&#39;s needed is the noise used in biome generation/the MoLang query.</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> We haven&#39;t taken a hard look at how we want to allow world generation to exist in scripting. Chunks generation runs on task threads and currently our gametest implementation doesn&#39;t allow for migration to other threads safely. We have some ideas to create something similar to web workers, but haven&#39;t gone further than conversations yet.</p></li></ul><h2 id="gametests-bds"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gametests-bds" aria-hidden="true">#</a> GameTests BDS</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Will gametest work smoothly on BDS soon?</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> We currently use BDS in our CI pipeline to run GameTest and validate the results!</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> Are there any areas where BDS and GameTest don&#39;t place nicely?</p></li><li><p><strong>A:</strong> One reason GameTest might not work is that the world needs to have the experiment enabled, which is not easy to do via dedicated server. The easiest way to do it today is use a Minecraft client to generate the world w/ the GameTest experiment turned on, and then transfer the world over to dedicated server.</p></li></ul><h2 id="as-someone-who-is-just-starting-to-learn-javascript-is-there-anything-you-can-recommend-that-would-help-new-coders-to-learn-gametests-talking-more-about-in-the-context-of-gametests-not-js-in-general"><a class="header-anchor" href="#as-someone-who-is-just-starting-to-learn-javascript-is-there-anything-you-can-recommend-that-would-help-new-coders-to-learn-gametests-talking-more-about-in-the-context-of-gametests-not-js-in-general" aria-hidden="true">#</a> As someone who is just starting to learn JavaScript, is there anything you can recommend that would help new coders to learn gametests?

Will it remain as a testing tool, or will it extend beyond, perhaps, to add totally new content?</h2><ul><li><p>For GameTest, we&#39;re looking to make the testing of content and validation much easier. We want it to be simple for folks to build tests around their content, their contraptions, and their scripts. Part of that is a rich script API for mocking and testing assertions, which we&#39;ve built out with the GameTest modules. We will be adding some new APIs as well to GameTest including some really cool methods for simulating players in the environment. We are also trying to figure out ways to make it even easier to create those JavaScript based tests.</p></li><li><p>Of course, a happy byproduct of GameTest is the opportunity to build out more of a generalized server-based scripting API which helps us explore how it could be used in scenarios down the road, as well.</p></li></ul><h2 id="you-ve-indicated-in-the-past-that-there-is-hope-all-commands-will-become-api-s-if-an-experimental-feature-arrives-will-it-get-api-support-and-if-so-will-that-be-in-an-experimental-module"><a class="header-anchor" href="#you-ve-indicated-in-the-past-that-there-is-hope-all-commands-will-become-api-s-if-an-experimental-feature-arrives-will-it-get-api-support-and-if-so-will-that-be-in-an-experimental-module" aria-hidden="true">#</a> you&#39;ve indicated in the past that there is hope all commands will become API&#39;s.
