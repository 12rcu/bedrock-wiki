However, in contrast to Java, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang itself, instead of the community.</p><p>In general, you can think of <em>mods</em> as <em>modifying</em> the game, and <em>addons</em> as <em>adding-onto</em> the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.</p><h2 id="what-is-this-guide"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-this-guide" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>What is this guide?</strong></h2><p>This guide is a beginner tutorial, created to make it possible for more people to start &#39;modding&#39; Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The guide will walk you through the creation of your very own fully-functional custom Entity (Ghost), that drops a custom item, Ectoplasm. By the end of the Guide you will have coded an add-on containing them, and be ready to continue onto your personal ones. Good luck!</p><h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-create-addons"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-i-need-to-create-addons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>What do I need to create Addons?</strong></h2><p>This guide be focused on creating addons on a Windows 10 PC for any Bedrock platform. However, the process is much the same when working on Android or iOS, although it is significantly more tedious. If something works differently on a mobile device, a note will state that.</p><h2 id="is-the-guide-up-to-date"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-the-guide-up-to-date" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>Is the guide up to date?</strong></h2><p>This guide is written for the most-recent <em>stable</em> release of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Many things won&#39;t work in previous versions, and some will be changed in later ones.
