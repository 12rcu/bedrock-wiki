There&#39;s a lot to cover, but I&#39;m mostly going to be covering the beginner&#39;s basics.<br> In Minecraft, there are 2 types of things, as a summary. Those 2 things are entities and blocks. You might&#39;ve heard of those a lot, and they&#39;re very important.<br><br></p><h2 id="basics"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Basics</h2><p>Here are some of the basics, read above for a bit of how to read this.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-block"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-block" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is a block?</h3><p>A block is essentially an object that takes up a 1x1 space. An example of a block would be say grass, dirt, etc. Everything in the below image is a block, don&#39;t worry about the water just yet.<br></p><p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/TqZjJ4m/FBB40-ECF-D2-F9-476-D-B56-B-1-EAA3-C6-D5-E08.png" alt="grassblock"><br></p><h3 id="what-is-an-entity"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-an-entity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is an entity?</h3><p>An entity as I like to think of it is any object that is not fixed to it&#39;s position, and can take damage. Water isn&#39;t fixed to it&#39;s position, is it an entity? No, the reason for that is because water cannot take damage.<br><strong>All mobs, but NOT only mobs</strong> are entities. Below is an example of an entity.<br></p><p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DGbPNgQ/Webp-net-resizeimage.png" alt="chicken.png"><br></p><br><br> Now that you know what entities and blocks are, that&#39;s a step forward.<br><h3 id="what-is-syntax"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-syntax" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is syntax?</h3><p>A quick explanation I&#39;ll give about syntaxes is that they&#39;re the format of the command, if your command doesn&#39;t<br> execute, then there&#39;s a chance it&#39;s that. Give all syntax errors a full read, if they don&#39;t work, take reference<br> from either the wiki, gamepedia, or the <code>/help &lt;command-name&gt;</code> command while in game.<br> An example of a syntax error is: <code>/kill @ e</code>. That specific one will be raised because there is a space between the <code>@</code> and the <code>e</code>. We&#39;ll go deeper into these <code>@</code> things in a bit. Below is an example of a syntax error. This most likely happened because the person didn&#39;t put an argument afterwards, but don&#39;t worry too much.<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/y590bt1/D20-D2-B44-1-A2-E-4-DF9-BB91-9238320-F5-A4-C.jpg" alt="error example"></p><h3 id="how-do-i-read-syntax"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-read-syntax" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How do I read syntax?</h3><p>Here&#39;s a quick sumnary, it isn&#39;t really accurate (I personally don&#39;t read them and somehow know it):<br><strong>Don&#39;t</strong> try to memorize the <code>something: type</code> ones if you don&#39;t understand.<br></p><ul><li><code>&lt;text_here&gt;</code>. These brackets mean that this argument is <strong>required</strong>.</li><li><code>[text_here]</code>. These brackets mean that this argument is <strong>optional</strong>.</li><li><code>(option1 | option2)</code>. These brackets mean that this argument <strong>must be one in the list</strong>.</li><li><code>|</code>. This character in a bracket means ’<strong>or</strong>‘.</li><li><code>something: int</code>. If <code>: int</code> is after something, that means the argument <strong>must be a whole number</strong>, also known as integers.</li><li><code>something: string</code>. If these are after something, that means the argument <strong>must be text</strong>, also known as string or str.</li><li><code>something: float</code> or <code>something: double</code>. If these are after something, that means the argument <strong>has a decimal place</strong>.</li></ul><h2 id="coordinate-management"><a class="header-anchor" href="#coordinate-management" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Coordinate Management</h2><p>This is a crucial part in commands.</p><h3 id="what-are-coordinates"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-coordinates" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are coordinates?</h3><p>To put it in my way, coordinates are really just the location of an object. But how do you know the coordinates?<br> How are coordinates formatted? Well, regarding both of them, there are three <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/axis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axes</a>, namely X, Y, and Z.<br><strong>How are they formatted?</strong><br> They are formatted in the standard way, <code>x y z</code>, and you&#39;ll see more about those later.<br><strong>How does one get the coordinates of something?</strong><br> It&#39;s quite simple to do this, you <strong>do not need to teleport</strong> yourself. You can simply run this command:<br><code>/gamerule showcoordinates true</code> and your coordinates should show <strong>at the top left</strong>. Once they&#39;re showing, read the numbers after<br><code>Position</code>. It should look somewhat like this: <code>Position: X, Y, Z</code>. If it doesn&#39;t show exactly like that, don&#39;t panic. X, Y, and Z are used to represent the number, whatever it is, is where your legs are. We&#39;ll be getting into<br> tildes on the next section, they will be necessary.</p><h3 id="what-are-tildes"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-tildes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are Tildes?</h3><p>Tildes are the <code>~</code> character, which in English means <strong>about</strong>, <strong>near</strong>, or <strong>here</strong>.<br> Same thing goes for coordinates in Minecraft.<br> Each tilde in a command represents from where the command is being executed, and math can be done on those.<br> To add to the coordinate: <code>~&lt;number&gt;</code>. This goes for all X, Y, and Z axes. You can also use <code>~+&lt;number&gt;</code>.<br> To remove from the coordinate: <code>~-&lt;number&gt;</code>. Note the <code>-</code>. This goes for all axes.<br></p><p>Say you want the player to teleport 10 blocks upwards, remember the Y axis is vertical.<br><code>tp &lt;target&gt; ~ ~10 ~</code>.<br> Now what is <code>target</code> you may ask. Target means the entity the command is being executed on.<br> This command moves the player 10 blocks up from the command block if there is one, or the person who executed it.<br> Don&#39;t worry yet about making the player do it, we&#39;ll cover it now.<br></p><h3 id="local-coordinates-caret-notation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#local-coordinates-caret-notation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Local Coordinates (Caret Notation)</h3><p>‘Caret Notation’ is another important part in Minecraft commands, it is local coordinates, it&#39;s a bit like tildes, however it&#39;s based on direction. Here&#39;s a quick summary:</p><ul><li><code>X</code> The X axis moves player <strong>to the left</strong>.</li><li><code>Y</code> The Y axis moves player <strong>up</strong>.</li><li><code>Z</code> The Z axis moves player <strong>forward</strong>.</li></ul><p>You may have thought that not all directions are covered in Caret notation, but really, they are. Tildes and Carets both take <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, so to go backwards, you can teleport the player using <code>^ ^ ^-1</code>, and that will send the player 1 block backwards.<br> Adding <code>-</code> in carets will go to the opposite direction of the axis, <code>right</code> and <code>down</code> are done the same way as backwards, except with the different coordinate. Both carets and tildes are <code>X Y Z</code> (<code>^ ^ ^</code>).</p><h2 id="entity-management"><a class="header-anchor" href="#entity-management" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Entity Management</h2><p>This section is on how to manage entities. There are a lot of commands that can affect entities, but here I&#39;ll cover the crucial ones.<br></p><h3 id="deleting-an-entity"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deleting-an-entity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Deleting an Entity</h3><p>It&#39;s very easy to delete an entity, you can simply use the kill command to delete an entity. But what if you wanted to delete a dropped item, or perhaps a specific mob? Below is more info.<br></p><h3 id="targetting"><a class="header-anchor" href="#targetting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Targetting</h3><p>You can use the target selector argument, which I will be specifying information about right here. You can use the <code>@e</code> targetting, but further than that is what we&#39;ll be focusing on.<br></p><h4 id="target-selectors"><a class="header-anchor" href="#target-selectors" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Target Selectors</h4><p>What are these? Well, I like to explain these as the main argument in selecting which entity to use.<br> A list of each one of them, and what they do is below:</p><ul><li><code>@p</code> This selects the nearest player from where the command was executed.</li><li><code>@r</code> This selects a random player in the world who is online.</li><li><code>@s</code> This selects the <strong>entity</strong> that executed the command. All entities, not only players included.</li><li><code>@a</code> This selects all the players.</li><li><code>@e</code> This selects all entites.</li></ul><p>For example, I want a creeper to say <code>Aww man</code> in the chat, I&#39;d use:<br><code>execute @e[type=creeper,name=&quot;creep.er&quot;] ~ ~ ~ say Aww man</code>.<br> You see those things in the <code>[]</code> brackets? They will be covered next.<br></p><p><code>@e[type=&lt;entity_type&gt;</code> will select a specific type of entity, this could be TNT, a dropped item, a specific mob type, etc, it can find any entity type. But what if you wanted a specific entity?<br><code>@e[type=&lt;entity_type&gt;,name=&lt;name&gt;</code>. With that, you&#39;ll find one of a name.<br> A very common issue I find others doing is when they&#39;re getting the name, they usually forget to add quotes after the <code>=</code> sign. If the mob has a space in the name, simply instead of <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>, imagine it becomes <code>&quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;</code>.<br> The <code>name</code> argument may be ugly, and so here is an alternative, this is also a way to group entities. <code>/tag &lt;target&gt; (add | remove) &lt;name: string&gt;</code>.<br> This will add a new group to the targetted entity, after adding it you can remove the name, if there is one.<br> Now <code>string</code> means to add quotes, just like the name in the target selector. In commands, and programming, <code>string</code> is just text data, which in most cases are set by <code>&quot;</code>. In Minecraft, use <code>&quot;</code>.<br> An example of a string is: <code>&quot;Hello World!&quot;</code>. In Minecraft, if you wrap with these quotes, you can use any character for any argument, including spaces. You may want to check for the range, here&#39;s how:<br><code>@e[r=&lt;range number&gt;]</code><br> In most guides, <code>number</code> will be represented as <code>int</code> or <code>integer</code>. They both mean a number. However, an <code>int</code> is not <code>float</code> nor <code>double</code> (if you&#39;re unsure ignore those two words), it cannot take a decimal value. <code>1.01</code> for example, is not an integer. An integer is just a whole number.<br></p><h2 id="execute"><a class="header-anchor" href="#execute" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Execute</h2><p><strong>This is an extremely important section!</strong> This section is fully dedicated to making entities execute a command, think of it as <code>sudo</code>, but for commands.<br> The execute command is the <strong>most powerful</strong> command in the entire game, but don&#39;t worry, it isn&#39;t hard to pick up on. <code>/execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;location&gt; &lt;selected command syntax&gt;</code> is the syntax. <code>&lt;selected command syntax&gt;</code><br> refers to the command you&#39;re getting the entity to execute. I always have my location as <code>~ ~ ~</code> and when it&#39;s<br> like that, it executes anywhere, that&#39;s at least what I use for myself.<br> But what if you wanted to check if someone was on a specific block type?<br><code>execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;position&gt; detect &lt;detectPos&gt; &lt;block_to_detect&gt; &lt;data value&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.<br> That would be your syntax. <code>detect</code> isn&#39;t in brackets, this means to just put it there, regardless.<br> Say you wanted a creeper walking on grass to kill nearby ocelots, you&#39;d use this: <code> /execute @e[type=creeper] ~ ~ ~ detect ~ ~-1 ~ grass kill @e[type=ocelot]</code></p><p>Quick notice, when stuck, try to use use effect, armor stands, tags and names.</p><h2 id="exporting-a-map"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exporting-a-map" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Exporting a Map</h2><p>Visit <a href="https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/e6ac9264b545580c95f93ce76d12cc71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to see how to.</p><h2 id="functions-structure"><a class="header-anchor" href="#functions-structure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Functions Structure</h2><p>Functions are very simple to make, here&#39;s a basic folder structure: Functions are a way to kinda import a ton of commands into new worlds easily, unlike command blocks however, they cannot be conditional.<br> When you run the <code>function</code> command, it executes the .mcfunction file named by your argument.<br><br> For example, a file named <code>cool_file.mcfunction</code> will execute if you return the argument as <code>cool_file</code> in other words,<br><code>/function cool_file</code> , however, if a different argument is written, the game will search for the <code>.mcfunction</code> file named by that, if none, the command will fail.<br></p><p><code>.mcfunction</code> files are always filled with nothing but commands.<br></p><p>Now for the folder setup.<br></p><p>Function Pack Structure:</p>',57),u=o("div",{markdown:"0",class:"folder-structure"},[o("ul",null,[o("li",null,[o("span",{class:"folder"},"BP"),o("ul",null,[o("li",null,[o("span",{class:"file"},"manifest.json")]),o("li",null,[o("span",{class:"image"},"pack_icon.png")]),o("li",null,[o("span",{class:"folder"},"functions"),o("ul",null,[o("li",null,[o("span",{class:"file"},"filename.mcfunction")]),o("li",null,[o("span",{class:"file"},"tick.json")])])])])])])],-1),g=o("p",null,[r("Here are "),o("a",{href:"https://github.com/VideoCarp/carpcorps/tree/master/function_packs",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"some open-source examples"),r(" of raw commands on GitHub.")],-1),p=o("p",null,[r("Learn about "),o("a",{href:"https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/mcfunction#creating-tickjson",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"tick.json")],-1);c.render=function(r,i,s,c,b,y){const f=e("Label");return t(),a("div",null,[d,l,o(f,{color:"green"},{default:n((()=>[h])),_:1}),m,u,g,p])};export default c;export{s as __pageData};
