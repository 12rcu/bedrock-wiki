However, in contrast to Java, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang itself, instead of the community.</p><p>In general, you can think of <em>mods</em> as <em>modifying</em> the game, and <em>addons</em> as <em>adding-onto</em> the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.</p><h2 id="what-is-this-guide"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-this-guide" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>What is this guide?</strong></h2><p>This guide is a beginner tutorial, created to make it possible for more people to start &#39;modding&#39; Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The guide will walk you through the creation of your very own fully-functional custom Entity (Ghost), that drops a custom item, Ectoplasm. By the end of the Guide you will have coded an add-on containing them, and be ready to continue onto your personal ones.
