However, in contrast to Java, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang itself, instead of the community.</p><p>In general, you can think of <em>mods</em> as <em>modifying</em> the game, and <em>addons</em> as <em>adding-onto</em> the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.</p><h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-create-addons"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-i-need-to-create-addons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>What do I need to create Addons?</strong></h2><p>This guide be focused on creating addons on a Windows 10 PC for any Bedrock platform.
