title: Contributing to the Bedrock Wiki
---

The Bedrock Wiki is fully open source. This means that is it maintained word-for-word by members of the community. If you've spotted a typo, an unclear description, or a missing page, please consider helping us out by submitting changes!

## Bedrock OSS

Bedrock OSS is a Github Organization that maintains many Bedrock resources, including the wiki! You can view our [github organization here](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS), and our [Discord here](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN).

Getting in touch via [Discord](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN) is the best way to discuss and learn about editing the wiki. We can offer support there in how to use github, how to make a pull request, and how to write valid markdown for the wiki.

## Contributing

Instructions for editing the wiki can be found in the readme of our [github repository.](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/bedrock-wiki).
