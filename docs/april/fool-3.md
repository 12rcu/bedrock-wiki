## Delivery

When you buy a chair, It is important to stay at home until It is delivered, or else you risk missing the drop off, and having it not delivered at all, or being issued a re-delivery.

## Arrival

When your new chairs arrive, and you welcome it into your home, you will not be able to spend any quality time with the new member of your family until the following has been completed:

### Unpacking

Your chair will most likely arrive in a box. Carefully open it, to prevent damage to it's contents. Damage to a young chair during these early stages can be fatal.

Upon box opening, you will find that your new chair is in pieces. Quite literally. DON'T PANIC. This is quite normal behaviour for a chair that has been in transit.

### Assembly

To put your chair together, you must follow these instructions to assemble it. First, you get the ||||| and use the //// and \\\\ together to make the \|/. You will need to be careful with the \|/, placing it lightly onto the /|\ before it falls apart again. You can also use glue. Then you take the brown piece and put it next to the black piece. If you're fast enough and score a 19 on the 52 sided die, you can then progress to applying the !, but again, carefully. Then you should be done. If not, refer to the beginning of this tutorial to start again from scratch, or contact customer support by asking nicely.

## You and your new Chair

Congratulations! You are now a pround owner of a chair. This really is something to be happy about. You and your chair have endless hours of fun and nothing but good times ahead of you, though be cautious, you must never do the following:

### Do not be near for more that 30 minutes

Doing so for longer will encourage agressive behaviours from the chair, things can go nasty very fast.

### Do not feed after midnight

Just don't do it

### Do not put in the washing machine

Chairs do not like being put through the wash, and won't ever forgive you if you do

### Do not leave in the sun or in e vehicle during summer

They can overheat extraordinarily fast and forgetting about them could be lethal for them. You can face fines of up to $500,010 if caught doing it

### Do not feed cookies

They won't stop bothering you if you ever let it try one

## Good Luck

Have a good time with your new chair, and happy Friday!
