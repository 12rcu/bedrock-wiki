# Beginners Guide

## **What exactly are Addons?**

An addon is the Minecraft Bedrock Edition (_Windows 10, iOS, Android, Consoles_) equivalent to Java mods. However, in contrast to Java, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang instead of the community.

In general, you can think of _mods_ as _modifying_ the game, and _ addons_ as _adding-onto_ the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.

## **What is this guide?**

This guide is a beginner tutorial created to make more people start 'modding' Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The guide will walk you through the creation of your very own fully-functional custom Entity (Ghost) that drops a custom item, Ectoplasm. By the end of the Guide, you will have coded an addon containing them and be ready to continue onto your ones. Good luck!

## **What do I need to create Addons?**

This guide is focused on creating addons on a Windows 10 PC for any Bedrock platform. However, the process is much the same when working on Android or iOS, although it is significantly more tedious. If something works differently on a mobile device, a note will state that.

## **Is the guide up to date?**

This guide is written for the most recent _stable_ release of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Many things won't work in previous versions, and some will be changed in later ones. We will keep the guide as up-to-date as possible, so no need to worry.

## Project Setup

Let's start by setting up your tools, which you will use throughout the development of your addons. This section will precisely cover what **software** is needed, where to **set up/initialize** your addons, and create a **workspace** where you can create your addons.

## Simple Custom Item

Now that your workspace is ready to go, we can start creating a fully custom Item that our entity will drop.

## Custom Entity

Finally, it's time to create the mob that drops our custom item: A hostile Ghost that spawns at night.

# What to do after finishing the Guide

Now, your first addon is complete! To further expand your knowledge, consider doing these:

-   Start your own project!
-   To dive into the other aspects of adding onto MCBE, you can use the different sections' sub guides listed in the [Appendix](/guide/appendix). This includes but is not limited to custom Blocks, Biomes, advanced Items, Animation Controllers, and even JS scripts. Some sections provide more technical in-depth tutorials and documents for each relevant topic.
