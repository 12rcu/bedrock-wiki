## **What is this guide?**

This guide is a beginner tutorial, created to make it possible for more people to start 'modding' Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The guide is intended to be followed step by step, and will guide you through the creaion of your first add-on, featuring a fully-functional custom entity with custom drops. Furthermore, once you're done with this guide, you'll find relevant subguides for every section on the Bedrock OSS Wiki.

## **What exactly are Addons?**

An addon is basically the Minecraft Bedrock Edition (_Windows 10, iOS, Android, Consoles_) equivalent to Java mods. However, in contrast to Java, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang itself, instead of the community.

In general, you can think of _mods_ as _modifying_ the game, and _addons_ as _adding-onto_ the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.

## **What do I need to create Addons?**

This guide be focused on creating addons on a Windows 10 PC for any Bedrock platform. However, the process is much the same when working on Android or iOS, although it is significantly more tedious. If something works differently on a mobile device, a note will state that.

## **Is the guide up to date?**

This guide is written for the most-recent _stable_ release of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Many things won't work in previous versions, and some will be changed in later ones. We will keep the guide as up-to-date is possible, so no need to worry.
