# Beginners Guide

## **What is this guide?**

This guide is a beginner tutorial, created to make it possible for more people to start 'modding' Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The guide is intended to be followed step by step, and will guide you through the creaion of your first add-on, featuring a fully-functional custom entity with custom drops. Furthermore, once you're done with this guide, you'll find relevant subguides for every section on the Bedrock OSS Wiki.

## **What exactly are Addons?**

An addon is basically the Minecraft Bedrock Edition (*Windows 10, iOS, Android, Consoles*) equivalent to Java mods. However, in contrast to Java, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang itself, instead of the community.

In general, you can think of *mods* as *modifying* the game, and *addons* as *adding-onto* the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.

## **What do I need  to create Addons?**

This guide be focused on creating addons on a Windows 10 PC for any Bedrock platform. However, the process is much the same when working on Android or iOS, although it is significantly more tedious. If something works differently on a mobile device, a note will state that.

## **Is the guide up to date?**

This guide is written for the most-recent *stable* release of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Many things won't work in previous versions, and some will be changed in later ones. We will keep the guide as up-to-date is possible, so no need to worry.

## Project Setup

Let's start by setting up your tools, which you will use throughout the development of your addons. This section will cover exactly what **software** is needed, where to **set up/initialize** your addons, how to create a **workspace** where you can create your addons.

[Project Setup](){: .btn .btn-green }

## Simple Custom Item

<!-- a simple introduction to addon syntax and so on-->
Now that your workspace is ready to go, we can start creating a fully custom Item, that our entity will drop.

[Custom Item](){: .btn .btn-green }

## Custom Entity

Finally, it's time to create the mob that drops our custom item: A hostile Ghost that spawns at night.

[Custom Entity](){: .btn .btn-green }

Now, your first addon is complete! To dive into the other aspects of adding onto MCBE, you can use the other sections' subguides, listed in the [Appendix](/guide/appendix.html). This includes but is not limited to custom Blocks, Biomes, advanced Items, Animation Controllers, and even JS scripts. The sections also provide more techichal in-depth tutorials and documents for each relevant topic.
