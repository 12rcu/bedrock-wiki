## Software Preparation

Let's start by setting up your tools, which you will use throughout the development of your addons. This section will cover exactly what **software** is needed, where to **set up** your addons, how to create a **workspace** where you can create your addons.

[Software Preparation](/guide/software-preparation.html){: .btn .btn-green }

## Project Setup

You will make your first steps in creating an addon here, by learning to create **manifests** and **pack_icons** (a.k.a initializing an addon), as well as learn to use some of the `.mc` file extensions. No previous coding experience required. After you'll create a testing World where you'll be able to test the first feature of your addon - a custom **/function**. We'll also learn about **transpiling Add-ons** and other **`.mc` file extensions**.

## Create Items

Now it's time to begin writing the first features of you addon. In this section you'll create a **simple** "Gem" **item**, and a **custom food**, as well as learn to link textures via **short names**.

[Custom Items](/guide/custom-items.html){: .btn .btn-green }

## Creating Blocks

Next up are **custom blocks**. You'll create a **simple block**, an **animated block** with a flipbook texture, a "Compass" block that has different textures for every direction and a block that imitates a Log.

## Loot tables, recipes, and spawn rules

Since you can now easily create custom blocks and items, it's time to learn about their custom **Loot Tables** and **Recipes**. While we're about it, we'll take a short look on entity **Spawn Rules** too.

[Loot tables & Spawn Rules](/guide/loot_tables-recipes-spawn_rules.html){: .btn .btn-green }

Now we're finally ready to create... **Custom Entities**. Make sure to polish your existing knowledge a bit before starting this chapter, as it will be a bit more complicated. First, we'll be using Blockbench to create the visuals, and then we'll define the Behaviors!

## Creating Particles

The next sub-chapter: Here you'll create **custom particles** and sounds and learn to trigger them via animations are auto triggers.

## World Generation

Let's move to something way different now: **World generation**!

## Skin Packs

And, something way different from everything we've done before: the creation of **custom Skin packs**!
